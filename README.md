🎓 ATTENDANCE RECORD SYSTEM

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW :

The Attendance Record System is a console-based Java application developed to manage and track attendance records of individuals. The system allows adding persons, marking attendance, updating records, and generating attendance summaries.
It follows a structured object-oriented design and demonstrates concepts such as exception handling, data validation, modular programming, and in-memory data management using ArrayLists.
This project is designed to simulate a real-world attendance tracking system in a simple and efficient manner using core Java.

✨ FEATURES :

➕ Add new persons to the system

🔍 Search person by ID

📝 Mark attendance (PRESENT / ABSENT / LEAVE)

✏ Update attendance status

📖 View attendance history of a person

📊 Calculate attendance percentage

📄 Generate attendance summary report

⚠ Custom exception handling for:

• Person not found

• Invalid attendance status

• Attendance record not found


🛠 TECHNOLOGIES USED :

☕ Java – Core programming language

📦 ArrayList – In-memory data storage

🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Encapsulation & modular structure

⚠ Exception Handling – Custom exception classes

💻 JDK – Compilation and execution environment

🖥 Console – User interaction interface


🏗 PROJECT STRUCTURE :

The project follows a modular layered approach:

• entity → Contains Person and AttendanceEntry classes

• service → Contains AttendanceService class (business logic)

• util → Contains custom exception classes

• main class → Handles console interaction
